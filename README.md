Downloading titiwai.py, the notebook, and the image, and installing all prerequisite libraries as indicated by the import statements in the code and notebook is sufficient to run the demonstration code. Any additional ".jpg" images added to the directory will be processed by the notebook together with the sample image. Other image types can also be processed with minor adjustments to the code. Each notebook cell begins with a comment summarizing its function, and can be adjusted as needed.
